# Gleitzsch version 4

Here we go again.

## Dependencies

1) Lame: <https://lame.sourceforge.io/>, just download/make the binary and add to $PATH
2) Scikit-image and numpy python libraries to operate with images as numpy arrays.
3) Pydub (required for operations over mp3 files only). This python library requires ffmped.
If you encounter any problems with this library, most likely there is somethig wrong with
your ffmpeg installation.
